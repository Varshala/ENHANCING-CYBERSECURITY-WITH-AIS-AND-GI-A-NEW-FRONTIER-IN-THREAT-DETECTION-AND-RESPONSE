# ENHANCING-CYBERSECURITY-WITH-AIS-AND-GI-A-NEW-FRONTIER-IN-THREAT-DETECTION-AND-RESPONSE

## Overview

Traditional systems struggle with evolving cyber threats. This model uses AIS for anomaly detection and GI for feature selection, improving accuracy and adaptability in detecting malicious activities.

## Dataset (UNSW-NB15)

Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository.

**Required files**:
- UNSW-NB15_1.csv
- UNSW-NB15_2.csv
- UNSW-NB15_3.csv
- UNSW-NB15_4.csv

**Download from**:  
https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset

Place all files in a folder named `UNSW_NB15_files/`.
